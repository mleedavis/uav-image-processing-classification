# uav-image-processing-classification

This repository contains example code flow to process and classify orthorectified UAV vegetation imagery 
to identify functional groups and species 

This requires processing orthomosaics, Digital Terrain Models (DTM), and 
Digital Surface Models (DSM) in 3rd party software, typically your flight
planning software, as input.
